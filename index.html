            <h1>What is Data Backup and Recovery?</h1>
            <h2>Data Backup</h2>
            <p> Data backup is the practice of copying data from a primary to a secondary location, 
                to protect it in case of a disaster, accident or malicious action. Data is the lifeblood of modern organizations,
                and losing data can cause massive damage and disrupt business operations. This is why backing up your 
                data is critical for all businesses, large and small.</p>
